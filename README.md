# Project Details

## Project Title: Movie Ticket Booking System

## Problem Statement:
In Albania there are not a lot of Movie Ticket Booking Websites in the market, some cinemas do not use them at all and prefer the old-fashioned way which is in-person ticket purchasing. That is inconvenient and time-consuming. Technology exists to make our lives easy that is why I saw it as necessary to offer this service.  Through the conduction of analysis, surveys, and checking on trends it came to my notice that some problems and things could be better regarding the current movie ticket booking websites. The biggest problem that most of the users faced was that the websites lacked user-friendly interfaces. Poorly designed websites often make the users prefer to make the payment in person rather than online. Other problems such as glitches when choosing seats and payment options were mentioned.

## Solution Proposed:
We are in a period where technology is “taking over the world”, therefore people should be offered a welcoming technological environment. I aim to make a website that directs the problems above. A website that is well-built, user-friendly, and which is safe, and easy to use.

## Project Scope:
- **Aim:**
-	This project will be focused on online purchasing of the tickets and not in-person purchasing of the tickets.
-	To infuse technology more into our everyday activities
-	The project aims to be introduced first in the capital of Albania which is Tirana then Durres and other regions
-	Adding more features such as different paying methods, accessibility, and others will probably not be implemented at the first release of the website.
 
- **Main Objectives:**
1.	Build a dynamic webpage
2.	Implement technology in our everyday activities.
3.	Make a user-friendly interface
4.	Build a safe backend system to store and save information about the users.
5.	Provide real-time information 

## Application Description:
This is a movie ticket booking website that aims to make the user's experience easier and to save time for the company as well as raise revenue. The website has two main users:
The movie watchers: will be using the interface to check on the available movies and book a seat for their wanted movie
The cinema: which will be the admin and will have access to the administration dashboard to check on the bookings and make changes to the interface of the website
Key Features:
-	A search bar to make it easier to find the desired movies.
-	Movies and their available times and dates
-	Visual selection of the seating positions, so the users have it easier to understand the positioning and select their favorite seat.
-	Log-in and Registration options, so that the data can be saved for that particular user and for them to choose if they want to log in or if they want to browse as a guest
-	Different payment methods
-	Booking information, so they can have real-time information about the ticket they purchased
We want to address the user’s needs therefore we aim to make the website:
-	User-friendly: our website will be easy to use even for those who do not have any experience with technology.
-	Efficiency: now the cinemas can save time on keeping track of their clients, also there won’t be a long waiting time and long lines to enter the cinema.
