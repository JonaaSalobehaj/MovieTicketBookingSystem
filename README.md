## Project Title: Movie Ticket Booking System

## Problem Statement:
In Albania there are not a lot of Movie Ticket Booking Websites in the market, some cinemas do not use them at all and prefer the old-fashioned way which is in-person ticket purchasing. That is inconvenient and time-consuming. Technology exists to make our lives easy that is why I saw it as necessary to offer this service.  Through the conduction of analysis, surveys, and checking on trends it came to my notice that some problems and things could be better regarding the current movie ticket booking websites. The biggest problem that most of the users faced was that the websites lacked user-friendly interfaces. Poorly designed websites often make the users prefer to make the payment in person rather than online. Other problems such as glitches when choosing seats and payment options were mentioned.

## Solution Proposed:
We are in a period where technology is “taking over the world”, therefore people should be offered a welcoming technological environment. I aim to make a website that directs the problems above. A website that is well-built, user-friendly, and which is safe, and easy to use.

## Project Scope:
- **Aim:**
-	This project will be focused on online purchasing of the tickets and not in-person purchasing of the tickets.
-	To infuse technology more into our everyday activities
-	The project aims to be introduced first in the capital of Albania which is Tirana then Durres and other regions
-	Adding more features such as different paying methods, accessibility, and others will probably not be implemented at the first release of the website.
 
- **Main Objectives:**
1.	Build a dynamic webpage
2.	Implement technology in our everyday activities.
3.	Make a user-friendly interface
4.	Build a safe backend system to store and save information about the users.
5.	Provide real-time information 

## Application Description:
This is a movie ticket booking website that aims to make the user's experience easier and to save time for the company as well as raise revenue. The website has two main users:
The movie watchers: will be using the interface to check on the available movies and book a seat for their wanted movie
The cinema: which will be the admin and will have access to the administration dashboard to check on the bookings and make changes to the interface of the website

Key Features:
-	A search bar to make it easier to find the desired movies.
-	Movies and their available times and dates
-	Visual selection of the seating positions, so the users have it easier to understand the positioning and select their favorite seat.
-	Log-in and Registration options, so that the data can be saved for that particular user and for them to choose if they want to log in or if they want to browse as a guest
-	Different payment methods
-	Booking information, so they can have real-time information about the ticket they purchased

We want to address the user’s needs therefore we aim to make the website:
-	User-friendly: our website will be easy to use even for those who do not have any experience with technology.
-	Efficiency: now the cinemas can save time on keeping track of their clients, also there won’t be a long waiting time and long lines to enter the cinema.

Submission Deadline: 18.03.2024, 23:59 
1.	Chosen Development Model: 

After analyzing the scope of the project, it was decided that the best method would be agile development. It is very efficient to use for those projects whose requirements are not given initially in detail by the user. It offers better adaptability, and changes can be done faster if requested. It highlights feedback and teamwork between the product owner and the developing team. By having frequent contact with the client, it lowers the risks coming with complex project leaving the costumer satisfied. 

2. User Requirements: 
a. Stakeholders: 
Identify key stakeholders, including end-users, clients, developers, and any other relevant parties. 
Provide a brief discussion on their roles and interests in the project. 
1.	End-users (Moviegoers): 
This are the primary users of the cinema website. They will interact with the website by searching for movies, looking at what movies are on that week and what will come soon, take information about the availability, register or login, choose their desired date and book the seat and receiving the booking ticket information. They require a user interface which is easy to use and to navigate.

2.	Client (Cinema Owners/Management):
The client is the one who we are working for. He initiates his requirements and features needed for the cinema. His aim is to sell as much ticket as possible so that the revenue can be increased. He requests for the website to maintain the brand identity and increase customer loyalty as well as to reduce the lines of waiting in the cinema. 

3.	Developers: 
The developers are responsible for building and maintaining the software. They make sure to build all the features required by the client such as a movie display page, booking page, motive ticket system and registration or login. They are here to make sure that there will be no troubleshooting or bugs happen. 

4.	Content Management Team:
They will responsible for updating the cinema website by using the administration dashboard where CRUD operations such as create, read, update, delete will be essential so that the information stays up to date. By researching the current market, they will create and promote the content and make sure that it engages as many users as possible. Also, they are responsible for customer service and support. They role will be to address the questions of the clients by navigating them with potential problems such as booking a movie, seat reservation, login or registration etc. 

b. User Stories: 
Present a few detailed user stories: 
Include the user type (e.g., administrator, end-user). 
Clearly outline the corresponding requirement and the benefit it brings to the user or project. 
-	User Story: End- User (Moviegoers)
Story: As a user I want to enter the website see the available movies and search for what I want to watch. Also, I would like to have some information about it before I decide to book a seat. 
Validation Requirements: The features in the software allows the end-user to have access on the search bar to search for their desired movie as well as to scroll though the website or to check the coming soon. Another feature is that for each movie there is information regarding: genre, running time, release date, actor who are, the language and a short description of the movie. Also, they can select their favorite seat in the cinema from our visualized seat placement.

4. Non-Functional Requirements: 
a. Brief Description: 
Describe how well your whole system should work. Is it about being fast, easy to use, or something else? Use simple words to explain each idea. 

Speed: The system should demonstrate a high-speed performance to be able to assist the client requirements even during the busy hours.
User-friendly interface: The system should be designed in a simple and easy manner for both clients and staff. It should be considered that not everyone has technologic background therefore the experience should be as good as possible.
Dependability: The system is expected to run without interruptions, timeouts or crashes.
Expendability: The system ought to handle the increasing workload or additional requirements accumulated over time.
Security: The system should guarantee the user safety from unauthorized attacks or information leaks.

b. Acceptance Criteria: 
For each idea, set a goal. If it's about speed, say exactly how fast it should be. If it's about being easy to use, describe what makes it easy. These are like rules to make sure your whole system is great. 
Speed: 
-	The loading time of the website should be as fast as possible. We require from our system to be 2 - 2.5 sec.
-	The time for completing the ticket booking system is estimated to be around 3 minutes including reading the information, selecting the date and time and booking the seat position.

User-friendly interface: 
-	The website is designed in such a way that is easy to navigate, the highlighted movies with a swiper action appear as soon as you open the website and everything is aligned in the necessary positions to be easily accessible even for people you have no knowledge in technology. 
-	The admin panel makes it easier for staff to keep the website updated and it requires little to no training to use it.

Dependability:
-	A decent uptime would be as near 100% as possible therefore we aim for it to be at least 99.5%.

C. Technologies used: 
List and briefly explain the technologies, frameworks, and languages chosen for development: Include any reasoning behind the choices, such as scalability or compatibility.

For frontend: 
- Html/CSS:  HTML helps in building the structure of the website by telling the computer how to display the content on the other hand CSS is essential if you want to style the website and improve the user’s experience.
- JavaScript is also used to make the website more interactive for the users.

For database: 
- MySQL: It is fast and powerful making it a good option out of many other database management systems. What makes it even better is that it is easy and free to use and offers a variety of database management system functionalities. 

For backend: 
- Java programing language: is an objected oriented, multiprogramming language. I chose to work with this language because its syntax is easy to understand and to maintain as well as it is easy to debug. 

 d. User Interface Design: 
Showcase wireframes, mockups, or describe the user interface: 
Provide a visual representation of how users will interact with the system. 
Here are some designs of the website worked on Figma: 
Other things that need to be added are:
- Login and registration: there will be two login containers. One dedicated to users who want to register/login for ticket purchasing and the other dedicated to administration dashboard.  
- Administration dashboard: This will be built to make it easier the maintenance of the website through CRUD operations. 




      
    
   

e. Security Measures: 
Briefly discuss the security measures and protocols implemented: 
Touch upon encryption, authentication, and any other security features.

The encryption process:
-	Transport Layer Security (TLS): Ensure that all browser or mobile TLS/SSL protocols are employed for secure communication between the server and client (the client's web browser or mobile app). This holds a feature of encrypting data even during transmission to eliminate interception and spoofing.
-	Data encryption: Guard against data leaks which can happen when user’s passwords, credit card numbers, or personal information kept in databases are not held by encryption technologies while idle. To store data in a database, employ a high-level encryption in ciphering (for example, AES) so that the data can only get decoded whenever necessary.

Verification and Authorization:

-	User Authentication: You need to ensure just the authenticated accounts are capable of gaining access to the system by introducing a plan to strengthen authentication measures. To finish off avoid any uninvited login and account hacking, you must rather make use of two-factor authentication (2FA), CAPTCHA, and password hashing with salt.
-	Access Control Based on Roles (RBAC): Set up and configure the required level of permissions for various user categories like employees and clients. Finally, apply access controls of these roles. Make sure users have only tasks and resources which they need for their job as well as position available.

Safe Integrations with Third Parties:

-	Vendor Security Evaluation: Prior to integrating their services into the system, assess the security posture of outside vendors and service providers (such as payment gateways and APIs). Ascertain those suppliers follow compliance guidelines and security requirements to reduce security risks related to third-party dependency.
